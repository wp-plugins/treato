== Description ==

Treato travels around the Web to collect and analyze patient written forum and blog posts. Our semantic technology analyzes posts in a way to help our users understand more about the medications they are taking and the diseases and symptoms they're experiencing - all from patient experiences.
With over 1 Billion collected posts, our users receive insight about effectiveness, side effects, drug comparisons and much more. 

The widget's size is 300x350 pixels, it can fit in most sidebars, and we are working on fitting it into sidebars narrower than 300 pixels too.
