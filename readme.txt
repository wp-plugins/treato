A snapshot of the Treato healthcare search engine: usable insights from aggregated patient experiences written in forums and blog posts.

== Description ==

[Treato](http://treato.com) travels around the web to collect and analyze patient experiences written in forums and blog posts. Our patented semantic technology aggregates the posts to generate useful insights about users' medications, diseases and symptoms - all from other patients.
With over 1 Billion collected posts, our users receive insight about side effects, drug comparisons, which drugs people feel work, and much more.

With this plugin you can add a sidebar widget which allows you and your users to search drugs see what patients are saying about different drugs.
